# Eye Movement Exercise

The exercise demonstrates mouse events and their ability to bind DOM elements to events. Two eye elements follow the mouse position on the screen.

## How to Run

Download the project, then open the HTML document in browser to see the eye movements in action.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

From this starting point, I could see myself experimenting with the eye shapes and page background to have this be a fun little interaction with an alien or monster.

## License
